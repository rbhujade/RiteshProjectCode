AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
You just write the function logic, and AWS handles the infrastructure.

Lambda Function =>  The code you write (in C#, Python, Node.js, etc.).
Event-driven => 	Automatically triggered by events (like API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, etc.).
Pay-as-you-go =>	You only pay when your function runs â€” by milliseconds and resources used.
Scalable	=> 		Automatically scales up or down based on the number of incoming events.

Limitation :
The maximum execution timeout for a function is 15 minutes*.
The disk space is limited to 512 MB and Configurable storage Up to 10 GB.
The default deployment package size is 50 MB for zip file,250 mb for unzipped.
The memory range is from 128 MB to 10 GB.
Request and response (synchronous calls) body payload size can be up to 6 MB.
The event request (asynchronous calls) body can be up to 256 KB.
package dependency Add 5 layers to your lambda function.

What is Serverless : 
"Serverless" does NOT mean there are no servers.

No server management =>	You don't provision, patch, or monitor servers.
Auto-scaling		=>	AWS scales your function automatically.
Micro-billing		=>	You pay only when code runs, no idle cost.
Event-based			=>	Functions are triggered by events, like HTTP requests, file uploads, etc.
