
Cognito :
We implemented secure user authentication using Cognito, leveraging its user pools for user directory and JWT tokens 
for API-level authentication."

Lambda:
We used AWS Lambda for our backend logic, which provided scalability and reduced operational overhead. 
Lambda was integrated with other AWS services like PostgreSQL and CloudWatch for seamless operations.

DB:
PostgreSQL was hosted on AWS RDS to ensure high availability and automated backups. 
We optimized database performance by tuning RDS parameter groups.

VPC:
Our architecture was built within a custom VPC to ensure security and control. 
RDS was placed in private subnets, while public subnets were used for Lambda to expose the API endpoints securely.

Security Group :
We configured fine-grained security groups to allow only required traffic between Lambda and RDS, 
ensuring minimal exposure to external networks.

Cloudwatch :
CloudWatch was used extensively for monitoring application health and diagnosing issues. 
Metrics and logs from Lambda and RDS were captured, and alerts were set for threshold breaches.

==========================================
Architecture Flow
User Access:
Users authenticate via AWS Cognito. JWT tokens are generated and passed with API requests.

Request Handling:
Requests hit API Gateway, which routes them to respective Lambda functions.

Data Processing:
Lambda functions perform the required logic and interact with PostgreSQL (RDS) for data retrieval or updates.

Networking:
The entire architecture resides in a VPC. Lambda functions operate in public subnets, and the database is secured in private subnets.

Security:
Security groups control traffic between Lambda and RDS. Access is strictly limited to necessary ports and IP ranges.

Monitoring:
CloudWatch monitors Lambda logs, RDS performance, and networking flow logs to ensure smooth operations.
