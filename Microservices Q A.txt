=============Microservices Architecture============
Microservices architecture is a design style where an application is structured as a 
	collection of small, independent, loosely coupled services ‚Äî each responsible for a specific business function.

Instead of building one large monolithic application, microservices break the app into autonomous units that can:
Be developed, Deployed, Scaled, Updated independently.

üß± Key Characteristics:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Single Responsibility:
Each microservice focuses on one business capability (e.g., User Service, Order Service, Payment Service).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Independent Deployment:
You can deploy one service without redeploying the entire application.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Decentralized Data Management:
Each service typically has its own database (Polyglot Persistence).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Communication via APIs:
Services talk to each other using lightweight protocols ‚Äî usually HTTP/HTTPS (REST) or gRPC, Message Queues (SQS, EventBridge).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Scalability:
You can scale only the service that needs more resources rather than the whole system.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Technology Diversity:
Each service can use the language and framework best suited for it (e.g., .NET Core for some, Python for others).


üèóÔ∏è Microservices Architecture Example (Your Project)
Based on your stack:
.NET Core 8 for backend services.
PostgreSQL for service-specific databases.
AWS Lambda for compute in serverless functions.
AWS Cognito for authentication & authorization.
SQS / EventBridge for async communication.
S3 for file storage.
CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.
RDS for relational data storage.


‚öôÔ∏è Flow Example:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Client sends request to API Gateway.
2Ô∏è‚É£ API Gateway routes the request to the appropriate Lambda-based microservice.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Service authenticates the user via AWS Cognito.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Service logic executes and queries PostgreSQL / RDS.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Events or notifications are sent via SQS/EventBridge.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Results are returned to the client or another microservice.


‚úÖ Benefits:
Faster development and deployment.
Independent scalability.
Easier maintenance.
Clear separation of concerns.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges:
More complex infrastructure.
Distributed system ‚Äî needs advanced monitoring/logging.
Data consistency issues.
Network latency and error handling.
